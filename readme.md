# Challenges

This repo is a collection of three challenges: one that requires identifying and solving a real-life bug you might encounter on the job and two that require building common markup patterns that we utilize on a day-to-day basis. Instructions for completion are contained within each challenges' `readme` file. 

## [Challenge 1](./challenge_one/readme.md)
